# Reflection from Last Quarterâ€¦

- Weâ€™ve had two workshops and two discussion panels
- Roughly about 100 students across two schools (Darnall Charter School, Mount Miguel High School)
- As of today, weâ€™ve pushed out three variants of the Intro to AI/ML workshop, plus an Intro to Python for elementary/middle school students
    - This is good content for reuse in the future!
- Goal for this quarter: Push out the Intro to WebDev workshop and Chatbot workshop

# Action Items

- Work on any prep necessary for Intro to Python Workshop
    - Who presents what?
    - Any content to add/remove?
- Continue fleshing out the Intro to WebDev and Chatbot workshops
