# Announcements

- Workshop of Workshops is next week!
    - Tuesday, November 12 @ 4-5pm in the Fishbowl
    - Still fleshing out details (food?)
- Some tech/hacking coachella thing happening in December, lost access to CSFE email so I don’t have/remember the details :(

# Action Items

- Let’s keep building/brainstorming!
- Let the CMs vote: Should we all continue to work on the WebDev workshop? Or should we choose another and start brainstorming for that?
    - Advantage of option 1: We can crank out a workshop (series) faster
    - Advantage of option 2: More variety to cater to wider interests
