# Announcements

- I’m planning to release a Workshop Lead Application Form sometime when finals are done. Deadline will be sometime very early in Winter Quarter, likely Week 1 or 2. Could be something to think about over break, but it will be open for quite a while.
    - Recall the responsibilities of the Workshop Lead
    - Looking to recruit 2 Workshop Leads
- If you’re not attending any of the two upcoming workshops, you are free to go! Use this time to go study, take a break, or whatever you need to do.
    - If you are, stay back because we got things to do >:)
- Best of luck with finals!
