# Announcements

- The two workshop leads have been selected!
    - Nehal Choudhary
    - Nicole Sutedja
- Both are new to CS foreach, so for the “veterans” here, give them a helping hand
- They will have an onboarding meeting next week, and will hopefully begin attending Curriculum meetings starting next week
- Still no upcoming workshops

# Action Items

- Somebody mentioned block-based coding last time, anyone up to draft some ideas?
- Start materializing a WebDev workshop
    - Create an outline of a lesson plan for high school students (~60-90 minutes)
    - Start making a slideshow presentation to accompany it. Refer to WoW slides for tips.
    - Think of some tools or demos we should include
    - Consider what your students will need for this workshop. Will they have to install any software, like VSCode? Any starter code we’re giving to them?
    - What other resources can we give them so that they can learn more?
        - Depending on the audience, can use the end of the workshop to plug CSFE activities (Tritonhacks for high schoolers)
    - Other ideas that might come up…
    - Tentative deadline: Week 5-7 Curriculum meeting

Consider using Pear Deck instead of Google Slides
